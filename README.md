# ImprovedCoffeeMachine
Using logical design with Java

## Introduction
In the previous lab, you laid the foundation for a virtual coffee machine by creating a hierarchy of coffee beverages. Now, it's time to elevate your barista skills by delving deeper into object-oriented programming concepts like polymorphism and separation of concerns.

The coffee machine you worked on needs to be upgraded to a sophisticated machine capable of brewing various coffee drinks with precision. Each coffee type must now have its unique preparation. As a star performer on your team, you are entrusted with creating and implementing this upgrade.

## Goal
Upgrade your virtual coffee machine by implementing polymorphism and creating a utility class to handle different coffee types and their preparation processes efficiently. This will make your virtual coffee machine versatile for preparing different coffee types while maintaining code efficiency and flexibility.

By the end of this lab, you should have a deep understanding of polymorphism, method overriding, and separation of concerns. These skills are fundamental to building robust and scalable software applications. As a software developer, youâ€™ll encounter similar challenges when working on various projects during your career. This lab provides a solid starting point for developing essential problem-solving and coding abilities.
